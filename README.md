# YMCA Classic
YMCAC (YMCA: Classic) is a mod of an OpenRA mod called YMCA. It updates an old version of the mod, adding new maps, balances and some other cool stuff.

As per usual with other OpenRA mods, download the installers in the release section.

(Finally got those damned installers to work if you couldn't already tell.)
