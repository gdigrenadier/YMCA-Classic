# YMCA-Classic
A older version of YMCA, just with new maps, some stuff and maaaaaaybe unit tweaks.

NOTE: Heavily recommended to download from the `MAIN` branch, not the `DEV` branch, since the `MAIN` generally *should* be less buggy.

To play, you will first need to click on the code button to then be able to click on the download button. Once downloaded, unzip the folder. 

Now there should be a folder called `Content` which contains RA and C&C95 assets and some other assets.

You will need to move the content folder to /appdata/roaming/openra/ which can be accessed by pressing win+r then typing `%appdata%` into the text box. 

It *should* hopefully run afterwards, if not, contact me on discord: gdigrenadier
