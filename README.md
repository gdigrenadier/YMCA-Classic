# YMCA-Classic
A older version of YMCA, just with new maps, some stuff and maaaaaaybe unit tweaks.

To play, you will first need to download the source code from a release. Once downloaded, unzip the folder. 

Now there should be a folder called `Content` which contains RA and C&C95 assets and some other assets.

You will need to move the content folder to /appdata/roaming/openra/ which can be accessed by pressing win+r then typing `%appdata%` into the text box. 

It *should* hopefully run afterwards, if not, contact me on discord: devgren
